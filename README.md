This branch contains the complete annotated corpus, consisting of 1.2000 sentences collected from the _ItWac reduced_ corpus (Baroni & Kilgarriff, 2006).

The documents also contain the _similarity score_ calculated between the model's output and the GS word for each sentence.

1) The EXPLICIT dataset (600 sentences) contains originally Explicit Objects as a GS.
2) The IMPLICIT dataset (600 sentences) contains manual annotations provided by two experts of both the GS Object's head and the type of omission, namely _Lexical Defaulting_ or _Pragmatic Defaulting_ (Jezek, 2018).
3) Both the original and lemmatized versions are provided for the IMPLICIT dataset.
