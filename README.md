This branch contains the complete annotated corpus, consisting of 1.2000 sentences collected from the _ItWac reduced_ corpus (Baroni & Kilgarriff, 2006).

The EXPLICIT dataset (600 sentences) contains originally Explicit Objects as a GS.
The IMPLICIT dataset (600 sentences) contains manual annotations provided by two experts of both the GS Object's head and the type of omission, namely _Lexical Defaulting_ or _Pragmatic Defaulting_ (Jezek, 2018).
Both the original and lemmatized versions are provided for the IMPLICIT dataset.

The files also contains the _similarity scores_ of the BERT models on the task of Implicit Object completion.
